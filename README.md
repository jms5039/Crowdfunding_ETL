# Crowdfunding ETL Project

## Overview
This project involves a collaborative effort to build an ETL pipeline focusing on crowdfunding data. Utilizing Python, Pandas, and SQL, we aim to extract data from provided Excel files, transform it according to specified requirements, and load it into a Postgres database. This README outlines the project structure, setup instructions, and the team's approach to tackling the tasks.

### Team Members
- Jacqueline Schuler
- Hilari Waters

## Repository Structure
Crowdfunding_ETL/  
│  
├── ETL_Mini_Project_[Initials].ipynb - Main project notebook.  
├── Resources/ - Contains source Excel files.  
│ ├── crowdfunding.xlsx  
│ └── contacts.xlsx  
├── csv_files/ - Exported CSV files.  
│ ├── category.csv  
│ ├── subcategory.csv  
│ ├── campaign.csv  
│ └── contacts.csv  
└── sql/  
└── crowdfunding_db_schema.sql - SQL schema for database creation.  

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone Repository**: One team member creates the repository and adds the other as a collaborator.

2. **Initial Setup**: Clone the repository to each member's local machine.

3. **Prepare the Workspace**:
   - Rename `ETL_Mini_Project_starter_code.ipynb` to include both members' initials.
   - Add the renamed notebook and the `Resources` folder to the repository.

4. **Work Distribution**: Divide the project tasks, ensuring regular communication and support.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Aim to complete at least half of the project by the third day of class.

## Project Tasks

### Data Extraction and Transformation

- **Categories and Subcategories**: Extract unique categories and subcategories from `crowdfunding.xlsx` to create corresponding DataFrames.

- **Campaign Data**: Transform data to create a comprehensive campaign DataFrame with detailed project information.

- **Contacts Data**: Utilize either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to process contact information from `contacts.xlsx`.

### Database Creation

- **ERD and Schema**: Design an ERD for the database and translate it into a SQL schema.

- **Database Setup**: Create a Postgres database and tables according to the schema.

- **Data Loading**: Import the CSV files into the corresponding database tables.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL
- Regular Expressions (optional)

## Collaboration Tools
- GitHub for version control
- Slack or Discord for team communication

## Hints and Tips

- Utilize `numpy.arange` for unique identifier generation.
- Refer to Pandas documentation for DataFrame operations.
- Use `astype()` for type conversions and Pandas string methods for data cleaning.
